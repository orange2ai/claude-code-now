# Content Creator Success Story & Topic Selection Philosophy

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations to one of our users who just hit 100K followers on both Douyin and WeChat Channels!

In just one month with 42 pieces of content, they reached 100K on WeChat Channels early on, and hit the milestone on Douyin today!

They used ListenHub's deep mode throughout to create audio content, then paired it with looping video visuals. Zero technical barriers - anyone can do this.

I encourage everyone to give Douyin and WeChat Channels a try.

But topic selection remains crucial. Here's Kha'Zix's topic selection philosophy for your reference:

## Kha'Zix's Topic Selection Philosophy

Honestly, I've always believed that topic selection is the most important factor in content creation - bar none.

Your topic determines 80% of your content's fate.

Actually, saying 80% might even be conservative - it could be as high as 99%.

With a mediocre topic, even if your writing is brilliant and you use every technique in the book, you'll likely get lukewarm results.

But with an exceptional topic, even if your writing is a bit plain, it could still go viral.

So what makes a good topic?

Through my own practice, I've developed an intersection model:

**A good topic = Your expertise + Readers' common interests + Current timing**

Just your expertise might be too niche; just readers' interests might be superficial; just riding trends might be fleeting.

Only when all three combine can you find that precise trigger point.

When these three overlap, your content gains real momentum.
