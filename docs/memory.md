# Claude Code Now Project Memory

## Core Positioning
The fastest Claude Code launcher on macOS - focus on one-click launch, achieve ultimate simplicity

## Technical Architecture
- `Claude Code Now.app/Contents/MacOS/ClaudeCodeLauncher` - Main launch script (AppleScript + Bash)
- `macos/claude-code-now.sh` - Command-line version
- `macos/set-terminal.sh` - Terminal configuration tool
- `windows/` - Windows-specific scripts
- `docs/` - Documentation and project memory
- `archives/` - Historical release versions
- `CNAME` - GitHub Pages domain config (claudecodenow.com)

## Important Decisions & Lessons

### Internationalization Principle
- **English as default**: All documentation (README.md, memory.md) use English as default language
- **Multilingual support**: Provide Chinese (README.zh.md) and Japanese (README.ja.md) versions
- **Commit messages**: Always write in English for global collaboration
- **Rationale**: Project targets global users, not just Chinese users

### PATH Detection Strategy
- Cannot rely solely on `command -v`, must traverse common installation locations
- Common paths: `~/.npm-global/bin`, `~/.npm/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`
- Users' Node.js installation methods vary (nvm, npm, brew), need full coverage

### Release Publishing
- ⚠️ **Important**: Must upload compiled `.zip` file with each release
- v1.0.0 - v1.2.0 only published source code, poor user experience
- v1.2.1 onwards upload App.zip, users download and use immediately

### Homebrew Formula Updates
- Need to sync update `claude-code-now.rb` with each new version
- Update version number + calculate new sha256: `curl -sL "https://github.com/orange2ai/claude-code-now/archive/vX.X.X.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256`
